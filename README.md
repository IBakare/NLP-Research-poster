Chatbot is the new way of interaction between humans and computers
and can be of help in digital learning. Just like any classroom, a chatbot
can facilitate seamless live communication and offer a great
personalized learning process. It reduces teacher-to-student physical
meetings as it can be available anytime. Natural Language
Processing(NLP) allows a computer to understand natural language as a
human. It takes input, processes it, and communicates it in codes to the
computer. This research aims at designing an efficient NLP
implemented chatbot for digital learning to create a conversational and
personal experience rather than just implementing computer
technologies.
RESEARCH QUESTION: How effective would a natural language
processing integrated chatbot be as a digital learning tool?
